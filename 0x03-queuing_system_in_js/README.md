##Redis and Node.js Project
###Introduction
This project aims to help you learn how to interact with Redis using Node.js. By the end of this project, you'll be able to run a Redis server, perform basic operations using the Redis client, and build an Express app that interacts with a Redis server. Additionally, you will learn how to manage queues using Kue, a Node.js job queue backed by Redis.

###Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

####Run a Redis Server on Your Machine:
Learn how to install and start a Redis server on your local machine.
####Run Simple Operations with the Redis Client:
Understand how to use the Redis command-line interface (CLI) to perform basic operations like setting and getting values.
####Use a Redis Client with Node.js for Basic Operations:
Integrate Redis with a Node.js application to perform basic Redis operations programmatically.
####Store Hash Values in Redis:
Learn how to use Redis hash data structures to store and retrieve key-value pairs.
####Handle Async Operations with Redis:
Manage asynchronous operations when interacting with Redis in a Node.js application.
####Use Kue as a Queue System:
Implement and manage a queue system using Kue and Redis.
####Build a Basic Express App Interacting with a Redis Server:
Create an Express.js application that communicates with a Redis server to store and retrieve data.
####Build a Basic Express App Interacting with a Redis Server and Queue:
Extend your Express app to interact with both a Redis server and a queue system using Kue.
